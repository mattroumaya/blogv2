Since I don't have any high-quality posts yet (and probably won't any time soonüí©), I'm just going to graph our endless rounds until we're out of the weeds. My friend and former colleague (and data pro!) Steph showed me how she was graphing nightly games of Rummy 500 with her wife, and I found the idea too fun to not steal üò∫!\n\nI spent all weekend getting up and running with the deadly [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) + [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) combo, and I'm ready to share my trivial data insights with the world!\n\nMolly and I love board games like [7 Wonders Duel](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/173346/7-wonders-duel/), [Codenames](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/178900/codenames), and some good ol' [Catan](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/13/catan) when we can round up... anyone else...but we have quickly come to terms that we'll be riding out the [stay at home order](https://www.phila.gov/2020-03-22-city-issues-stay-at-home-order-clarifying-restrictions-on-business-activity-in-philadelphia/) for quite a while.\n\n(If you're only looking for cats and kittens, scroll to the end)\n\n**Let's take a first glimpse at our scorecard data:**\n\n![Messy Data With Competitive Annotation](IMG-2914.jpg){width=\"40%\"}\n\nWhile the raw data explicitly shows that I'm a loser, we'll see if that's actually the case after some cleaning and viz.\n\n**Here's a `tribble` of our cumulative rounds:**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nrummy <- tribble(\n  ~Round,~Molly,~Matt,\n  1,159,167,\n  2,90,100,\n  3,55,139,\n  4,91,-25,\n  5,98,44,\n  6,97,64,\n  7,68,68,\n  8,102,90,\n  9,53,85,\n  10,-21,134,\n  11,88,144,\n  12,-23,106,\n  13,63,111,\n  14,91,128,\n  15,108,79,\n  16,88,76,\n  17,100,146,\n  18,124,-10,\n  19,66,41,\n  20,77,105,\n  21,38,95,\n  22,91,13,\n  23,92,117,\n  24,65,101,\n  25,88,142\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nTo build some suspense before we get to the cumulative sum and see who the real *loser* üò≠ is, we actually need to utilize one of my new favorite functions `pivot_longer()`, which will help us visualize our rounds.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrummy_wider <- rummy %>%\n  pivot_longer(cols = c(\"Molly\",\"Matt\"), values_to = \"Score\") %>%\n  rename(Player = name)\n```\n:::\n\n\n**Now our data looks like this:**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Round </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Player </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Score </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Molly </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 159 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Matt </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 167 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 2 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Molly </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 90 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 2 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Matt </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 100 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 3 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Molly </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 55 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 3 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Matt </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 139 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Nice!

This definitely isn't the best visualization I've made, and would have been more interesting with a third player (maybe the [thruple from HGTV's **House Hunters**?](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/throuple-house-hunters-hgtv_n_5e46d120c5b64d860fca24df))\n\nAnyway, to work with `ggbump`, we just need to rank each round.
