My blog is depressingly stagnant and I want to make more of an effort to just post things without putting too much thought into it.

For that reason, this post will be **extremely** brief, and will just show a useful trick that uses `dput()`, which was unfamiliar to me until I started looking for ways to contribute to the `R` tag on [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/12967938/matt).

Here's the sort(a)-scenario:

Let's say you have a vector that's built into your code that you'd like to sort. I've been stuck on an idea for a blog post about [Saves the Day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwW0q65VIas), and have a vector that contains body parts.

```{r}
parts <- c("neck", "collarbone", "ankle", "thigh", "eyelid")
```

I like order in the world, and want to build this vector alphabetically, which will also make it easier to read as it's presented in a blog post.

Instead of doing your A-B-C's and manually rewriting the vector, just use `dput()`!

```{r}
dput(sort(parts))
```

Easy!

Now we can just copy/paste and move on with our lives!

```{r}
ordered_parts <- c("ankle", "collarbone", "eyelid", "neck", "thigh")
```
