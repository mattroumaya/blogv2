As someone who has literally never had a fun time working in Access, I was thrilled to be assigned to this project, and was then quickly humbled by the task at hand.\nIt has been easy enough to create parameterized HTML reports for a handful of internal users, but when the audience is external at a scale of thousands of reports, the processing time in generating the reports quickly becomes a major consideration in operationalizing the solution.\nAfter tweaking code, unsuccessfully experimenting with cache = TRUE, and several cups of coffee ‚òï, I finally found a reasonable solution using the foreach and doParallel packages as suggested by a colleague, in reference to an email from 2018 from a different organization dealing with the same exact dilemma.\nThe first thing I learned that really helped understand why my PDF reports were being compiled so slowly is that R is single threaded by default. This is a new concept to me so I‚Äôm not going to even pretend to fully understand it, but I found this resource to be super helpful.\nFor this quick demo, we will need to make an RMarkdown file and an R file."

The bot has ~700 followers and not much engagement, but it has definitely been a fun way to learn about web scraping, bot building, and CRON jobs via GitHub Actions (repo is here).\nRecently, the World‚Äôs Smartest Man pulled the plug on Twitter‚Äôs API access for a wide range of developers, including NUFORC Bot. For some reason, NUFORC Bot is now back up and running, but it seems like it will be short-lived.\nAfter the hostile takeover, I stopped using my personal account on Twitter, deleted the app, and planned to just let NUFORC Bot ride off into the sunset. Now that the sunset is quickly approaching, I‚Äôve been trying to think of a way to reproduce a similar effect to the tweet using the data I have already collected.\nHaving been a subscriber to hrbrmstr‚Äôs Daily Drop for a while, I‚Äôve seen a ton of amazing Observable notebooks, and thought that this could be a fun project to learn Observable and see . The impending demise of NUFORC Bot was as good an excuse as any to hack together an Observable notebook that can do everything that NUFORC Bot did + MORE üëΩ.\n\n\nImport From Observable\nIt‚Äôs kind of amazing how little code is needed to create the random report above.\n\nImporting two functions from my Observable Notebook\nReading data with d3. This could also be done in R but is more concise in a single chunk, and I‚Äôm planning to use ojs_define() in a later post.\n\n\nimport { selectRandom, addHeader } from \"@mroumaya/random-ufo\"\n \nufoReport = d3.csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mattroumaya/mufonbot/master/data_raw/links.csv')\n \nufo = addHeader(selectRandom(ufoReport));\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe only other code that‚Äôs needed is some HTML to display the NUFORC report data. Observable has a Hypertext Literal implementation that I definitely didn‚Äôt leverage correctly, but looks like this:\n\n\nhtl.html`&lt;h3 class='header'&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n \n&lt;div class=\"date\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n \n&lt;div class=\"shape\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n \n&lt;div class=\"duration\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;\n \n&lt;a class=\"report-link\"&gt;Link to Report&lt;/a&gt;\n \n&lt;br&gt;\n \n&lt;a class=\"raw-link\"&gt;Link to Image&lt;/a&gt;\n \n&lt;br&gt;\n \n&lt;br&gt;\n \n&lt;div class=\"summary\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n \n&lt;img id=\"ufo-img\" style=\"height: 500px\"&gt;\n \n&lt;br&gt;`"
