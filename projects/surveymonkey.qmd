I inherited the [surveymonkey R package](https://github.com/mattroumaya/surveymonkey) from Sam Firke (formerly at [TNTP](https://tntp.org/)) and have maintained the package since 2021. The surveymonkey package lets R users query the SurveyMonkey API directly to bring survey responses into R for quick and easy analysis.
