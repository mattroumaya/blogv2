The [{gsm} package](https://github.com/Gilead-BioStats/gsm) provides a standardized workflow that leverages Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) and thresholds to conduct study-level Risk Based Monitoring (RBM) for clinical trials. I have been privileged to work with an amazing team of developers from Atorus and Gilead, and have made contributions to this project since January 2022.
