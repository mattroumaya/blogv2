I had some trouble setting up PostgreSQL via Homebrew and am documenting the steps for future reference (and maybe it'll help someone)!

## Install via Homebrew üè†üç∫:

I'm installing [`v16`](https://postgresql.org/about/news/postgresql-16-released-2715/).

``` zsh
# check and update homebrew
brew doctor
brew update

# install postgresql@16
brew install postgresql@16
```

## Start Services

Start postgresql now that everything is installed:

``` zsh
brew services start postgresql@16
```

This is where I encountered my issue, which was that the `PATH` was not set, so all PostgreSQL terminal commands were not recognized (despite looking like all is well after starting `brew services`).

## Find Path

To resolve this, I needed to find the `/bin` where postgres is installed:

``` zsh
 sudo find / -name pg_config
```

This returned a few matches, but the one I needed was: `/System/Volumes/Data/opt/homebrew/Cellar/postgresql@16/16.2_1/bin/pg_config`

To set a persistent path, I ran:

``` zsh
open ~/.zshrc
```

... and pasted:

``` zsh
export PATH=$PATH:/System/Volumes/Data/opt/homebrew/Cellar/postgresql@16/16.2_1/bin/
```

Now it should work! Check it with:

``` zsh
psql --version
```

## Learning More

I have [phillymetal](https://phillymetal.net/) on Supabase, but have been thinking of making a similar resource for jazz music in the area. I'd like to learn how to develop a database outside of a hosted platform and deploy it with Docker, so that's my tentative plan.
