I'm a Data Solutions Engineer \@ [Atorus](https://www.atorusresearch.com/). My goal is to share trivial and occasionally useful R content, learn from and connect with others in the data community, and contribute to open source. I live in Philadelphia with my amazing wife Molly, our two cats, Mango and Phil, and our dog Donut. As a huge fan of heavy music, I also run [phillymetal.net](https://phillymetal.net/ "link to phillymetal.net"), a website that helps people in the Philadelphia area find metal shows ðŸ¤˜.
